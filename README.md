# 10-team-profile-generator
This assignment was assigned by the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full Stack Flex Boot Camp.
This is assignment 10 for the program. In this assignment I created a command line application that generates an HTML containing team creation information. The program takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This program also features test driven development using jest.

It contains notable features such as:
- high quality HTML generation based on user input
- user input prompts for
  - Team Manager
    - name
    - employee ID
    - email address
    - office number
  - Engineer member
    - name
    - employee ID
    - email address
    - github username
  - Intern member
    - name
    - employee ID
    - email address
    - school
- user input begins with Team Manager and then prompts for user choice to add additional Engineers and/or interns
